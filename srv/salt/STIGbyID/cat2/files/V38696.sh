#     The operating system must employ automated mechanisms, per 
#     organization defined frequency, to detect the addition of 
#     unauthorized components/devices into the operating system. By 
#     default, AIDE does not install itself for periodic execution. 
#     Periodically running AIDE may reveal unexpected changes in installed 
#     files.
