#     A file integrity tool must be used at least weekly to check for 
#     unauthorized file changes, particularly the addition of unauthorized 
#     system libraries or binaries, or for unauthorized modification to 
#     authorized system libraries or binaries. By default, AIDE does not 
#     install itself for periodic execution. Periodically running AIDE may 
#     reveal unexpected changes in installed files.
